Clone [Trivia](https://github.com/caradojo/trivia) from the legacy code retreat is a good codebase to start this with. 

## Procedure
1. Identify a weakness in the design
2. State what the potential bug is **before explaining your solution**. This is important, simply saying another 
solution is better avoids thinking of **why** it is actually better.
3. Explain or refactor the code to show the new design.

The purpose is to experiment with design alternatives, so it is not necessary to refactor until perfection, and it is optional to use tests.
The purpose of first explaining the problem in the design is to make sure that the new design is not just different but also adresses one or more specific problems.
