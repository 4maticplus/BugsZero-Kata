# BugsZero Kata

Practice refactoring code to repel bugs. 

Bugs get their way into the code because the design allows it. Bugs are not a fatality
and finding ways to improve the design is a very powerful way of keeping them away from our code. 

You can think of this dojo like a Poka-Yoke training, understand and fix the root cause of the bugs.

# What is the task?

[Trivia](https://github.com/caradojo/trivia) from the legacy code retreat is a good codebase to start this with.
There are a few bugs in the code and a few weaknesses in the design to fix. 
By a weakness we mean that it'd be easy for a developer to introduce a certain type of bug 
while working with the code. Your job is to change the design so that it is either impossible
or at least much less likely that that kind of bug would be introduced.
