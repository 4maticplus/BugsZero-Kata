# BugsZero Kata

Practice refactoring code to repel bugs. 

Bugs get their way into the code because the design allows it. Bugs are not a fatality
and finding ways to improve the design is a very powerful way of keeping them away from our code. 

You can think of this dojo like a Poka-Yoke training, understand and fix the root cause of the bugs.


# Where to start?

## Beginner
Make sure you know of a few ways to design away bugs, by looking at a few examples
* [5 steps to mistake-proof software design](http://mozaicworks.com/blog/5-steps-to-mistake-proof-software-design/)
* [It's not a configuration issue. Itâ€™s a design issue](http://martinsson-johan.blogspot.fr/2016/06/its-not-configuration-issue-its-design.html)

## Intermediate
We've found some weaknesses for you. Pick your choice in instructions-intermediate.md

## Advanced
If you'e already accustomed this thinking this way, have a look at instructions-advanced.md

# Next steps
A few pointers on typical weak design that is bug prone can be [found here](https://github.com/martinsson/BugsZero-Kata)

Go use this on some other code base.


The purpose is to experiment with design alternatives, so it is not necessary to refactor until perfection, and it is optional to use tests.
The purpose of first explaining the problem in the design is to make sure that the new design is not just different but also adresses one or more specific problems.
