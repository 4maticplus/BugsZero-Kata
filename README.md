# BugsZero Kata

Practice refactoring code to repel bugs. 

Bugs get their way into the code because the design allows it. Bugs are not a fatality
and finding ways to improve the design is a very powerful way of keeping them away from our code. 

You can think of this dojo like a Poka-Yoke training, understand and fix the root cause of the bugs.

# Where do I start?

## Beginner
Make sure you know of a few ways to design away bugs, by looking at a few examples
* [5 steps to mistake-proof software design](http://mozaicworks.com/blog/5-steps-to-mistake-proof-software-design/)
* [It's not a configuration issue. Itâ€™s a design issue](http://martinsson-johan.blogspot.fr/2016/06/its-not-configuration-issue-its-design.html)

## Intermediate
We've found some weaknesses for you. Pick your choice in [instructions-intermediate.md](https://github.com/martinsson/BugsZero-Kata/blob/master/instructions-intermediate.md)

## Advanced
If you'e already accustomed this thinking this way, have a look at [instructions-advanced.md](https://github.com/martinsson/BugsZero-Kata/blob/master/instructions-advanced.md)

## Next steps
A list of bug-patterns, common, mostly unnecessary weaknesses in design.

Go use this on some other code base!
 
Give us some suggestions in the issues.
