# BugsZero-Kata
Practice Designing code for less bugs 

Take any codebase that you'e familiar with, and try to identify either existing bugs or bugs that could be easily 
introduced by other developers while they extend the code. Imagine an alternative design that would make that 
type of bug impossible or less likely. You'll need existing code to analyze, 
so take a project like the Legacy Code Retreat [trivia](https://github.com/caradojo/trivia) example.

## Procedure
1. Identify a weakness in the design
2. State what the potential bug is **before explaining your solution**
3. Explain or refactor the code to show the new design.

The purpose is to experiment with design alternatives, so it is not necessary to refactor until perfection, and it is optional to use tests.
The purpose of first explaining the problem in the design is to make sure that the new design is not just different but also adresses one or more specific problems.
